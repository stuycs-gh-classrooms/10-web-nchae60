    <p>When graphed with the same units of a zero order reaction, it will appear as a negative exponential graph.
    Because a second order reaction appears to be very similar, they must be distinguished by the y-axis they can be graphed against in order to achieve
    a linear graph. In the case of a first-order reaction, graphing it against the natural log (ln) of the numeric concentration achieves linearization.

	<p> The reason natural log is present in this order of reaction is explained better in a mathematical sense, though it involves calculus, something that isn't expected of sophomore AP Chemistry students.

    <div class="firsttext">
	<p> When the differential is integrated into a linear equation, the observed and initial concentrations serve as y and b respectively in the slope-intercept form.
	In simpler terms, the natural logarithm function reveals the linear trend by compressing larger values and expanding small values, a manipulation that happens to work well with exponential decay in first order.
