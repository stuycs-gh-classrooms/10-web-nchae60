	     In chemistry, the order of a reaction refers to the relationship between the concentration of reactants and the rate of the reaction in which those reactants are used.
	More specifically, it refers to how the rate of a reaction changes with respect to a change in the concentration of reactants. There are a variety of reasons for the existence of
  different reaction orders, including the involvement of some catalyst, the individual steps or 'mechanisms' of the reaction, external factors like temperature or pressure, and many more.
  Identifying the order of a reaction is very useful to analysis and data collection.
</p>
<p>
	Once data is collected experimentally with several trials involving keeping the concentration of all reactants but one constant for all relevant reactants, some simple
	math can be used in trial and error to identify the order of the reaction with respect to said reactants.
	Without using multivariable calculus, a reaction of zero, first, or second order can have its order identified by manipulating the graph of concentrations to time, a method that is central to the AP Chemistry Kinetics unit.
  <br>
	This website details some of these manipulations and further information on each reaction order.

    Something to note about what causes the order of a reaction is that only the slowest step impacts the overall rate of reaction, and thus it is referred to as the 'rate determining step'. A way to visualize
    it is an assembly line, in which the slowest working machine in the line is the sole arbiter of the production speed.
