	     In chemistry, the order of a reaction refers to the relationship between the concentration of reactants and the rate of the reaction in which those reactants are used.
	More specifically, it refers to how the rate of a reaction changes with respect to a change in the concentration of reactants.

	Once data is collected experimentally with several trials involving keeping the concentration of all reactants but one constant for all relevant reactants, some simple
	math can be used in trial and error to identify the order of the reaction with respect to said reactants.
	Without using multivariable calculus, a reaction of zero, first, or second order can have its order identified by manipulating the graph of concentration to reaction rate.
	This website details some of these manipulations and further information on each reaction order.
