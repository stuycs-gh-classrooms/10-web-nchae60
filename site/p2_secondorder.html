      When graphed against the reciprocal of the numeric concentration, a second order reaction will linearize.
        As stated prior, if these reactions are graphed against numeric concentration, the second and first order appear far too
        similar to distinguish reliably.

	<p> Akin to the first-order reaction, explaining linearization involves calculus, and the mathematical explanation is that integrating the differential equation
	leads to a linear equation in which the reciprocal concentration happens to be the y and b terms. The major difference, however, appears once the graph is linearized.
	While the first and zero order reactions linearize with a negative slope, the second order reaction linearizes with a positive slope, as the progress of the reaction causes the denominator of the function to decrease.
