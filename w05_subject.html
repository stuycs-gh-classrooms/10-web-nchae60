    <h2>Zero Order Reactions</h2>
    <p>When graphed against the numeric concentration of the reactant with an x-axis of time, it will linearize.</p>

    <h2>First Order Reactions</h2>
    <p>When graphed with the same units of a zero order reaction, it will appear as a negative exponential graph.
     <br>
    Because a second order reaction appears the same, they must be distinguished by the y-axis they can be graphed against in order to achieve 
     <br>
    a linear graph. In the case of a first-order reaction, graphing it against the natural log (ln) of the numeric concentration achieves linearization.

    <h2>Second Order Reactions</h2>
    <p>When graphed against the reciprocal of the numeric concentration, a second order reaction will linearize. 
        <br>
        As stated prior, if these reactions are graphed against numeric concentration, the second and first order appear far too
        <br>
        similar to distinguish reliably.
